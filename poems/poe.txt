Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore
From that rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore

...

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
"Wretch!" I cried, "Thy God hath sent thee! By these angels he hath lent thee
Respite, respite and nepenthe from these memories of Lenore
Quaff, oh quaff, this kind nepenthe and forget the lost lenore
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."
