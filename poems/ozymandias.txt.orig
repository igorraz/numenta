I met a traveler from an antique land
Who said, "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies
Whose frown and wrinked lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed
And on the pedastal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings!
Look on my words, ye mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Around the decay
Of that Collossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
        Percy Bysshe Shelly
        



But my life is now forfeit for I have seen the glory of the king of kings...
Ozymandias the Great!


For someone failed to clean up this text properly, but I have now...
